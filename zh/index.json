We provide a comprehensive structured view of claims, including rich claim attributes (such as claimers and claimer affiliations) and associated knowledge elements as claim semantics (such as events, relations and entities), enabling users to explore equivalent, refuting, or supporting claims with structural evidence, such as shared claimers, similar centroid events and arguments. In order to consolidate claim structures at the corpus-level, we leverage Wikidata as the hub to merge coreferential knowledge elements. The system automatically provides users a comprehensive exposure to COVID-19 related claims, their importance, and their interconnections.

In reality, the ontology of interest may change over time, adding emergent new types or more fine-grained subtypes. We propose a new lifelong learning framework to address this challenge. We focus on lifelong event detection as an exemplar case and propose a new problem formulation that is also generalizable to other IE tasks. In event detection and more general IE tasks, rich correlations or semantic relatedness exist among hierarchical knowledge element types. In our proposed framework, knowledge is being transferred between learned old event types and new event types. Specifically, we update old knowledge with new event types′ mentions using a self-training loss. In addition, we aggregate old event types′ representations based on their similarities with new event types to initialize the new event types′ representations. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms competitive baselines with a 5.1% absolute gain in the F1 score. Moreover, our proposed framework can boost the F1 score for over 30% absolute gain on some new long-tail rare event types with few training instances. Our knowledge transfer module improves performance on both learned event types and new event types under the lifelong learning setting, showing that it helps consolidate old knowledge and improve novel knowledge acquisition.","tags":null,"title":"Lifelong Event Detection with Knowledge Transfer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaodan Hu","于鹏飞","Kevin Knight","Heng Ji","Bo Li","Honghui Shi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c2f0fce9c3de5813638ba4d7e1d7a572","permalink":"https://perfec-yu.github.io/zh/publication/xiaodan-2021-muse/","publishdate":"2022-06-25T20:43:20.044556Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/xiaodan-2021-muse/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"MUSE: Textual Attributes Guided Portrait Painting Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["于鹏飞","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Empirical results show that even the most competitive few-shot learning models struggle on this task, especially as compared with humans.

While distant supervision is effective to scale relation extraction up to large-scale corpora, it inevitably suffers from the wrong labeling problem. Many efforts have been devoted to identifying valid instances from noisy data. However, most existing methods handle each relation in isolation, regardless of rich semantic correlations located in relation hierarchies. In this paper, we aim to incorporate the hierarchical information of relations for distantly supervised relation extraction and propose a novel hierarchical attention scheme. The multiple layers of our hierarchical attention scheme provide coarse-to-fine granularity to better identify valid instances, which is especially effective for extracting those long-tail relations. The experimental results on a large-scale benchmark dataset demonstrate that our models are capable of modeling the hierarchical information of relations and significantly outperform other baselines.
